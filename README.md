# Advance Python Calculator
This is an advance calculator for python that has REPL execution method on the terminal. The app has basic calculator functionality and statistic functionality. This project is a part of IS-601 course.

All of the data handling is done by pandas.
Created an intuitive interface for simplifying complex pandas functionality.

Done rigourous testing on the code and achieved **99% coverage** (all of the main functionalities have **100% coverage**).

All the test cases passed and proper formatting of the code was maininted with pylint.

Implemented proper logging functionality.

Practiced good version control and proper commit history.

Used clean code principles for proper maintainable and scalable codebase.



The application has the following functionalities (these are all **plugins**):
- add
  - add's two numbers
- subtract
  - subtract two numbers
- multiply
